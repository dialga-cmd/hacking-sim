# Hacking simulator

This fun python project will make a hacking simulation for you to run and flex in front of your friends. 
None of the commands written here will actually run, they all just echo in pygame envionment.

## Installation

Install python 3.11 and pygame in order to run this code

```bash
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/
pip install pygame
```
While installing python from the above url, make sure you check "Add in PATH" (i forgot the exact line that was here). You can find the checkbox in the first dialog box when you run the launcher

I forgot to add a license, hope that won't put me in danger
